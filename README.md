Status: planning stage  

Project on hold until Swift has resolved the issue of "variadic generics", as discussed here:
			
- [Generics Manifesto - Variadic generics](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/GenericsManifesto.md#variadic-generics)
- [Improving the UI of generics](https://forums.swift.org/t/improving-the-ui-of-generics/22814)
